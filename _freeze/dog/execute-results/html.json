You can start by booking an inital 1.5 hour walk at any available times on my Calendly. If your pup seems like a long term fit for the group, we can discuss booking at a weekly or monthly rate.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"5%\"}\n<!-- empty column to create gap -->\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n### [Rover](https://www.rover.com/sit/justig74774)\n\nThis is typically a good way to book a one time service. Since this is done through the platform, my prices are a bit higher to accounts for the 25% fee rover takes on all bookings. If you want to work something out long term after booking, we can discuss my non-Rover price points\n\nUse this [link](https://www.rover.com/sit/justig74774) to check out my profile and book, and use the promocode: **JUSTIG74774** for \\$20 off your first walk.\n:::\n:::\n",
