She hasn’t had issues since, but I have included the rest of her antibiotics (please text me poo photos if you need assistance). \nGrooming you shouldn’t have to worry about this at all. I gave her a nice bath yesterday (April 5th). She gets a bath once a week, so unless you notice extenuating circumstances, don’t feel pressured to bathe her."

    "text": "Poop / Pee Schedule\nWhile Phoebe is not 100% potty-trained, here are some pointers: \nFor poopies:  She typically will need to poop around 30 mins - 1 hour after eating a meal. This is when I typically take her on walks. \n* She also will do a VERY slow squatting motion. If you are fast, just yell “Good girl!, come with me!” and she will follow you to the best area before doing the deed\n\nFor pee-pees: I’m sorry, but I haven’t found the magic bullet here. If you discover any tricks that work to bring home, it would be greatly appreciated"
