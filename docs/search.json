You can start by booking an inital 1.5 hour walk at any available times on my Calendly. If your pup seems like a long term fit for the group, we can discuss booking at a weekly or monthly rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nRover\nThis is typically a good way to book a one time service. Since this is done through the platform, my prices are a bit higher to accounts for the 25% fee rover takes on all bookings. If you want to work something out long term after booking, we can discuss my non-Rover price points\nUse this link to check out my profile and book, and use the promocode: JUSTIG74774 for $20 off your first walk."

She hasn’t had issues since, but I have included the rest of her antibiotics (please text me poo photos if you need assistance). \nGrooming you shouldn’t have to worry about this at all. I gave her a nice bath yesterday (April 5th). She gets a bath once a week, so unless you notice extenuating circumstances, don’t feel pressured to bathe her."

This is when I typically take her on walks. \n* She also will do a VERY slow squatting motion. If you are fast, just yell “Good girl!, come with me!” and she will follow you to the best area before doing the deed\n\nFor pee-pees: I’m sorry, but I haven’t found the magic bullet here. If you discover any tricks that work to bring home, it would be greatly appreciated"
