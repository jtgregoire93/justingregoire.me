One-pager with useful information about Phoebe! This includes shots she has included, her eating schedule / diet, general temperament, and hopefully some fun pictures / other data projects related to Phoebe I can think of.

## **Feeding Schedule + Directions**


## **Health & Grooming**

**Health-wise**, she is up to date on all her shots (reattaching medical records to this form). Back in November 2022, she had a little bout of Ghirardi. She hasn't had issues since, but I have included the rest of her antibiotics (please text me poo photos if you need assistance). 

**Grooming** you shouldn't have to worry about this at all. I gave her a nice bath yesterday (April 5th). She gets a bath once a week, so unless you notice extenuating circumstances, don't feel pressured to bathe her.

## **Poop / Pee Schedule**

While Phoebe is not 100% potty-trained, here are some pointers: 

**For poopies:**  She typically will need to poop around 30 mins - 1 hour after eating a meal. This is when I typically take her on walks. 

\* She also will do a VERY slow squatting motion. If you are fast, just yell "Good girl!, come with me!" and she will follow you to the best area before doing the deed

\
**For pee-pees:** I'm sorry, but I haven't found the magic bullet here. If you discover any tricks that work to bring home, it would be greatly appreciated
